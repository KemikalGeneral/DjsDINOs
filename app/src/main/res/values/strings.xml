    <!--Dino Content-->
    <string name="abelisaurus_info">This dinosaur from South America is part of a group of meat eaters that evolved separately from the more famous Tyrannosaurus on the northern continents.
        It had a high skull and extremely powerful jaw muscles - its jaw could slam shut so fast that its prey did not have time to react.
        Scientists have found a 1 meter (3 feet) long skull but they do not know how large Abelisaurus grew.
    </string>
    <string name="compsognathus_info">Compsognathus was a theropod the size of a large turkey, and an active predator of small animals.
        One specimen has a complete lizard inside its stomach - it had been swallowed whole.
        Its relatively small teeth were adapted to grabbing prey but not to slicing them, as bigger theropods\' teeth were.
        Compsognathus was found in the same fossil deposit as the first bird, Archeopteryx, and the famous pterosaurs Rhamphorbynchus and Pterodactylus.
        They all lived in a lagoon-like area.

        \n\nCompsognathus was an agile predator.
        It may have also been two-fingered but the hands found were not intact so scientists cannot be sure.
    </string>
    <string name="diplodocus_info">If the word "sleek" could be applied to a sauropod, then that would describe Diplodocus.
        Its main body weight was slightly larger than that of an elephant.
        Its great length came from its long neck and tail.
        Diplodocus stood on the edge of a river or lake and used its neck like a vacuum cleaner.
        Its pencil-like teeth raked up soft-fiber plants.
        Its food was swallowed whole - sauropods could not chew.

        \n\nBig Reach&#8230;
        \nDiplodocus\'s back legs were longer than its front legs.
        It probably reared up onto its hind legs to reach leaves in taller trees or perhaps to scare off predators.

        \n\nFeet&#8230;
        \nDiplodocus had four big feet to help carry its large weight.
        It also walked on its toes, as elephants do.</string>
    <string name="spinosaurus_info">This 12ton predator was a spinosaur. Spinosaurus were unusual Theropods with crocodile-like skulls and a \'sail\' on their back.
        The sail probably helped regulate body temperature and was used as a display for mating and territory disputes.
        The spines along Spinosaurus\'s back were more than 1.8m (6feet) high. It had long hands with long, curved claws.
        It may have used its claws to hunt fish.

        \n\nSpinosaurus was one of the biggest meat-eating dinosaurs ever to have lived. It may have used its sail to cool down its huge body.
        It would have stayed in the shade when it got too hot and pumped warm blood into the skin on its sail.
        The blood cooled down before returning to the rest of its body. </string>
    <string name="stegosaurus_info">Stegosaurus is the most famous of all the armoured and plated dinosaurs.
        This dinosaur was designed to defend itself against its main predators, Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Torvosaurus.
        It had 17 large plates and four tail spikes.
        It could not outrun its attackers, in fact, it could not run at all, which is why it relied on defence.
        Even its own throat was protected by more than 100 small bones in the skin.

        \n\nSpikes and Plates&#8230;
        \nStegosaurus used the plates at the end of its tail to swipe at and stab attackers.
        Its plates were used for protection and may have been used to regulate temperature.

        \n\nGiant Plant Eater&#8230;
        \nStegosaurus had a small head and a long nose.
        Its teeth were all at the back of its mouth and its upper and lower teeth ground against each other to cut and slice its food.
        It had a sharp beak at the front of its mouth that was used to cut its food like a a pair of shears would.
        It may have had pouches in its cheeks where it stored food before chewing it.
    </string>
    <string name="triceratops_info">This famous dinosaur was one of the last dinosaurs to live on the Earth.
        Triceratops is also famous for being a food source for Tyrannosaurus Rex.
        Its frill counterbalanced the weight of its head, which was where its massive jaw muscles attached.
        It had the strongest jaws of any plant eater.
        Its teeth sharpened themselves on their food and were replaced throughout its life.
        They sheared past each other like giant shears.
        Triceratops could chomp its way through any vegetation.
        Although it looked like a Rhinoceros, it could not gallop like one.
        It was much slower than T-Rex and had to rely on its huge horns for defence.

        \n\nA Survivor&#8230;
        \nAlthough Triceratops lived when there were many fierce theropods, including Tyrannosaurus, it survived until the end of the Cretaceous.
        It used its three horns to charge and stab its attackers and it used its frill to protect its neck from predators\' teeth.

        \n\nHorns and Frill&#8230;
        \nTriceratops\'s two horns above its eyes grew to more than 1m (3 feet) long.
        The horn on its nose was smaller.
        Triceratops\'s frill could have been used for courtship and temperature regulation.
        Triceratops\'s horns were part of its skull - they were made of bone.
        Triceratops had a short frill made of solid bone on its head.
        The frill was covered in skin.
    </string>
    <string name="tyrannosaurus_info">Tyrannosaurus rex is the most famous dinosaur of all time.
        It lived at the end of the Cretaceous and dined on Triceratops and Edmontosaurus.
        There have been two other contenders for the \'largest land predator of all time\' - Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus.
        However, T-Rex had a larger and more powerful skull.
        Its teeth were thicker and longer - they grew more than 14cm (5 inches) above the gum line.
        Both sides of each tooth had serrations, similar to a saw\'s.
        T-Rex could gulp down 20kg (44 lbs) of meat in one swallow.
        It is hard to tell whether T-Rex was a predator or a scavenger but it was probably both.

        \n\nMighty Hunter&#8230;
        \nTyrannosaurus had good eyesight, a strong jaw, and powerful legs.
        Its arms, however, were small and it had two-fingered, clawed hands.
        Tyrannosaurus survived by scavenging and by actively hunting prey.

        \n\nTyrannosaurus Skull&#8230;
        \nThe skull of Tyrannosaurus was powerful enough to crunch down and kill its prey.
        Its heavy jaw had an extra joint in the middle, so the mouth could open wide to take extra-large bites.
        It had bony nits above and below its eyes to protect them from being damaged by struggling prey.</string>
    <string name="velociraptor_info">
        Velociraptor was a lightly built, fast predator with a deadly sickle-shaped claw on each foot.
        Its relatively large brain size tells us that it must have been one of the smartest dinosaurs.
        It is also one of the most famous.
        In the Gobi Desert, in 1971, a complete skeleton was found locked in a death grip with Protoceratops.
        These two dinosaurs have been fighting for more than 75 million years.

        \n\nBumps on a Wing&#8230;
        \nVelociraptor was a two-legged, feathered dinosaur.
        We know it had feathers because scientists recently found knobs on a Velociraptors forearm that were the same as the bumps on bird wingbones where their feathers were connected.

        \n\nBrains&#8230;
        \nVelociraptor had a large brain for its body size.
        The only smarter dinosaur that we know of is Troodon.
